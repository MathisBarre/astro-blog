title: "Who am I?"

Here is the page where I'm going to talk a lot about who I am. If you don't like me, you better leave this page right now. I'm not going to be responsible for any mental damage you might get from reading this page.

Also, I'm french. That why I'm attacking you like that (and that's also why my english is probably not perfect).

## Current work

I'm currently working at [Hero](https://www.heropay.eu) as a fullstack software engineer. Hero is a fintech startup providing various financial services to fast growing businesses to help them grow even faster.

Because of the nature of the company, we have to be very careful about the quality of the software we produce.
As a result, I'm learning a lot about automated testing software architecture and code quality.

The human side of it is also very interesting. I'll probably write a blog post about it at some point.

## Side project

I'm currently working on a side project called RowingBeacon. It's a digital rowing logbook for rowing club.
It will not get me rich, but I'm learning a lot about how to build a product from scratch and how to market it.
I will probably write articles about it.

I worked on it since a long time. It's slow because I'm always changing my mind about how I want to get things done. But unlike my other side projects, I still want to work on it after months. So I'm not giving up.

## Career path

### Studies & first experiences

I'm developing since I'm 10 years old. I'm mainly self-taught. I started my profesionnal carrer with a bit of freelancing and a one year internship.

### First real experience

I then worked at a mobile agency doing React Native. At first, I learned a lot. Especially about mobile development, of course. Unfortunately the React Native was small and without a lot of senior developers. I started to feel like I was not learning anymore. Another opportunity came and I took it.

### The dream job

This opportunity was a big one! I succeeded to join [Shotgun](https://shotgun.live), a live event ticketing platform. It was cool because I am a big fan of techno music and Shotgun is the main ticketing platform for techno events in France. I was very proud to work there.

In addition of that, the tech stack was based on the Javascript ecosystem, the one I already used and love. This experience introduced me to the world of backend development and I learned a lot about it.

Unfortunately, I got fired. I wasn't a good fit for the team due to my lack of experience, which was incompatible with the extremely fast-growing and extra competitive context of the scale-up. I had to leave after the eight-month probation period. I was very sad about it, but I learned a lot, made great friends, and I'm grateful for the experience.

### And now?

Now, I'm at Hero. I already talked about it above ("current work" section) if you are curious.
